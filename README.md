TransitScape is a ride scheduling platform that enables users to plan and schedule their rides in advance. The app is designed to streamline the scheduling process for users, by allowing them to input their pickup and drop-off locations, preferred vehicle type, number of people travelling and desired time of travel. The app then uses algorithms to optimize the scheduling of rides based on user demand and driver availability.

Our app aims to address the growing need for users who require transportation on a regular basis, such as daily commuters or business travellers or someone going to catch a flight, train or anything personal and doesn't want a hassle at the last moment. By providing a platform that allows users to plan and schedule their rides in advance, we aim to improve the overall efficiency and convenience of ride-hailing services. Additionally, the use of algorithms allows us to optimize the scheduling process for both users and drivers, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient ride-hailing experience.

One of the key features of our app is the ability for users to schedule rides in advance for a certain period be it hours, days or weeks it keeps track of everything and serve at the right time. This enables users to plan their transportation needs ahead of time, and gives them the flexibility to make changes or cancel their rides if necessary. The app also provides real-time updates and notifications to users in advance, allowing them to track the status of their ride and receive alerts on any changes or delays.

Our app also benefits drivers by allowing them to view and select rides from a grand schedule of all ride requests for a given day in advance based on the area they will be in or want to go to.

TransitScape automates the repetitive routine of travelling of people and free them of their daily hassle of booking cabs. Just book the ride in advance and focus on your gig that you are going for. The app will assign the rides of different riders a day before their scheduled ride by providing the grand schedule of rides of the next day to the drivers a day before and giving them the opportunity to choose from those rides according to their area of interest.

This is in development phase and will get more mature and advance over time.
